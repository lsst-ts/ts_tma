Software deployment
===================
Each machine has different software running on them.
In the following section, the software is installed on the computers.
  
TMA Windows

HMI
===

The HMI is installed as a LabVIEW runtime executable on the TMA CentOS machine.
The operation manager is installed as an RPM package which leverages systemd service architecture.


TMA PXI
=======

The PXI is a model 1086.

Use NI-MAX to install NI Linux RT system image along with Variable Engine and Ethercat driver.

Then create configuration directories and files using `this document <https://gitlab.tekniker.es/publico/3151-lsst/documentation/pxicontroller_documentation/-/blob/master/80%20DeployOnTargets/01%20TMA%20PXI.md?ref_type=heads>`_.

.. prompt:: bash

  mkdir -p /c/Configuration/CAR_TCP /c/Configuration/DiscreteStateReporting /c/Configuration/EIB /c/Configuration/Safety /c/Configuration/TekNSVs /c/Configuration/axisManagementComm

Find the files under the `ESIfiles` directory of the PXIController repo.
Most of the folders match the names on the cRIO.
Some of the files have the suffix ForATS and those are the ones that you want to copy.

This is the PXI where the control code for all subsystems is running.
To be able to configure the TMA PXI, the development PC should be configured as shown in the deployment document.
