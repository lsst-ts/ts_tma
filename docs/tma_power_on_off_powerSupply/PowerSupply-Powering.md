# Power Supply Powering ON/OFF

This document explains how and what to check for powering on and off the Power Supply.

## Powering on

1. Clear all the interlocks that affect the Power Supply, these can be [checked here](https://ts-tma.lsst.io/docs/tma_tma-is_safety-matrix/index.html)
   1. For clearing these use the [Safety System window in the EUI](https://ts-tma.lsst.io/docs/tma_eui-manual-english/02_Monitor%26Control/034_SafetySystem.html)
   2. And if there is something from the GIS active, clear that on the GIS
2. With the interlocks cleared, press the ON button, the one on the very top of the [Power Supply window](https://ts-tma.lsst.io/docs/tma_eui-manual-english/02_Monitor%26Control/018_PowerSupply.html)
4. The system should power on
   1. If the process fails, usually due to problems in the fuses, check the fuses for any broken ones
   2. If this persists contact the electronics team.

## Powering off

For powering off, this should be easier than the on sequence.

1. Go to the [Power Supply window](https://ts-tma.lsst.io/docs/tma_eui-manual-english/02_Monitor%26Control/018_PowerSupply.html) and press OFF on the top
2. The Power Supply should be OFF
