## Introduction

This document describes the procedure to setup the different systems for running the automatic test system.

## Software Deployment

Each hardware has different software parts, and some hardware had more than one software part. In the following sections
each hardware element is explained.

### Windows Machine

In the Windows Machine some simulators and some tools are running. Start installing the Force EtherCAT Variables
installer, this will install the LabVIEW runtime needed in many other tools and simulators.

#### Force EtherCAT Variables DEPRECATED

This tool allows writing data to EtherCAT variables to other simulators using a TCP based custom protocol. The value
written using this tool will overwrite any set value, so any slave value will be overwritten with the written value. The
source code and more documentation about configuration can be found in
[this repo](https://github.com/lsst-ts/ts_tma_hil_force-ethercat-vars)

Follow next steps to deploy this software:

1. If the installer is available continue to step 6
2. Clone the repository in the link above
3. Open the project `ForceEtherCATVars.lvproj`
4. Go to *Build Specifications* and right click in *ForceIOs* to select *Build*
5. Go to *Build Specifications* and right click in *ForceEtherCatVars Installer* to select *Build*
6. When compilation is finished, open location and copy the `Volume` folder to Windows Machine
7. Install the tool using the *install.exe*
8. Run *ForceIOs.exe*.

#### Read/Write Network Shared Variables Tool

This tool allows reading and writing data from network shared variables to other simulators and back using a TCP based
custom protocol. The source code and more documentation about configuration can be found in

### TMA PXI

This is the PXI where the control code for all subsystems is running. To be able to configure the TMA PXI, the
development PC should be configured as shown in the
[deployment document](https://ts-tma.lsst.io/docs/tma_maintenance_deployment/deployment.html#development-pc)

1. Download the [PXI repository](https://github.com/lsst-ts/ts_tma_labview_pxi-controller)
2. Open the `ATS_Projects/ATS_LSST_MainControllerPXI.lvproj`
3. Ensure that in the project properties the *Conditional Disable Symbol* `HIL` is set to `True`

    1. Right click in the project an select properties

    ![Project properties](./media/proyectProperties.png)

    2. In the opened window go to *Conditional Disable Symbols* page and set the value for `HIL` symbol to `True`.

    ![Conditional Disable Symbols for TMA PXI](./media/conditionaldisableSymbols.png)

4. Open the main `RT_MCS_Main.vi`
   1. Solve the requested dependencies if they appear.
   2. Close the main.
   3. Save all the request files.
5. Build the `rtexe`
   1. Open the *Build Specifications* section
   2. Right click and build

    ![alt text](media/BuildRtexe.png)

6. Once built, deploy the rtexe to the target. This can be done using SSH (scp) or with the LabVIEW project.
7. Before rebooting the PXI, deploy the Network Shared Variables (NSVs) for the ATS.
   1. Open the `ATS_Projects/ATS_TMA_PXI.lvproj`
   2. Connect the project to the PXI
   3. Deploy the `ATS_ECATSlave_NSV.lvlib`. This lib contains the NSVs for the ATS simulation mode.

    ![DeployAtsEthercatSlave](media/DeployAtsEthercatSlave.png)

   4. Disconnect from the project
8. Reboot the PXI -> check the boot of the PXI with the *labviewmessages* alias command

  > To test just one subsystem some specific test VIs can be found inside the corresponding subsystem folder. For
  > example the Balancing specific test VI shown bellow:
  >
  > ![Balancing test code](./media/balancingTestCode.png)
  >
  > These are not built, but could be run and deployed from the project directly if needed

### Axes PXI

Same as TMA-PXI, but instead of opening the TMA project, open the `ATS_Projects/ATS_MainAxes.lvproj` and the
`MAIN_AxesPXI.vi`. And instead of deploying the NSVs library, deploy the ethercat master, see image below.

![Deploy ethercat master](media/DeployEthercatMaster.png)

### AUX PXI

Same as TMA-PXI, but instead of opening the TMA project, open the `ATS_Projects/ATS_AuxSystemsController.lvproj` and the
`AuxSystemsMain.vi`. For this PXI there are no libraries to be deployed

### Safety code deployment

The code that runs on the PILZ controller to simulate the behavior of the TMA IS. The source code and more
documentation about configuration can be found in
[this repo](https://github.com/lsst-ts/ts_tma_hil_test-dual-modbus)

1. Open the *TestDualModbus* project with *PAS4000* version 1.18.0
2. Activate the *TestDualModbus*

  ![Activate project](./media/PasActivateProject.png)

3. Open the online network editor.

  ![Open network editor](./media/PasOpenNetworkEditor.png)

4. Scan project to scan the network to verify that the PILZ CPU is connected.

  ![Scan project](./media/ScanProject.png)

5. Close the online network editor
6. Download the project
    1. Open the Project downloader:

    ![Open project downloader](./media/PasOpenProjectDownloader.png)

    > If asked to build changes say YES
    > ![Build changes](./media/PasBuildChanges.png)

    2. Start download:

    ![Start download](./media/PasStartDownload.png)

    3. Confirm download:

    ![Confirm download](./media/PasConfirmDownload.png)

    4. Download completed:

    ![Download complete](./media/PasDownloadComplete.png)

7. Logout:

  ![Logout](./media/PasLogOut.jpg)

8. Close the PAS4000

## Relevant considerations and miscellaneous

### Database

When setting up the ATS is important to have a separated database instance just for the ATS system, the backups for these
can be found [**here**](https://github.com/lsst-ts/ts_tma_ats_database-backup).

### Cabinet modbus temperature controllers

For the auxiliary cabinets temperature controllers the `Send reset` and `Reset value` settings are updated to *TRUE* and
*1* respectively, to act as a power on when sending the reset command. This means that each time the cabinets simulators
is booted, the cabinets temperature controllers would be off, until a reset command is sent to each of them.

> This is done with the `ManualReset` variable from the PXI which for the ATS is pointing to the `1016` register of the
> simulators, the power register.

![Auxiliary boxes after sending a reset command](media/AuxiliaryBoxesEnabled.png)

### Elevation inclinometer

The default value for the elevation inclinometer variable `TMA-EL-CS-CBT-0101-220A30_ElevationInclinometer` is set to
`10430` which means a position of `45.22500002` deg. This is done to have a valid EL position when powering on the EL
axis, this variable is not updated by any simulator, but it can be manually updated.

### EUI

The executable of the EUI for the ATS and the TMA are the same, the only difference is that the database, the PXIs and
the operation manager it targets must be different. This is why the ATS must use a different instance of the EUI than
the real TMA, for this we recommend using a different machine. The EUI can be installed from a RPM package found
[here](https://repo-nexus.lsst.org/nexus/#browse/search=keyword%3Dtma_eui)
